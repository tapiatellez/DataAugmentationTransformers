It actually turned out to be pretty decent as far as B-list horror/suspense films go.   The thing that really really hit me for the most was the way in which this kind of stuff can really be done in horror. 	1
Definitely worth checking out.   I think it's a good story.  There are some very specific points you need to understand and find the book and watch it.  It's certainly worth taking a look at.   I will have	1
MANNA FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time.    I've never been a huge fan of horror films, and I know when I was growing up that the characters were predictable. 	1

John Wayne did an incredible job for being so young in the movie industry.   He has been on a really good run. But his film has been an utter failure, not only because of that, but because of the fact that no one has	1

Though The Wind and the Lion is told largely through the eyes of the son, every member of the family can identify with one of the characters, whether it be Sean Connery's noble brigand, Candace Bergen's feisty heroine, John Huston's wily John Hay or Steve Kanaly's spiffy, radiant, ruthless can-do lieutenant, Roosevelt's "Big Stick".  	1

This second appearance of Mickey Mouse (following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year) is probably his most famous film--mostly because it was so ground-breaking.              	1
While you don't yet hear Mickey speak, there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the film--something we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928.            	1

This is a masterful piece of film-making, with many themes simmering and occasionally boiling over in this warts and all study of the poet's bohemian, self-indulgent wartime years that span the aerial bombardments of London and the outward tranquillity of a Welsh coastal retreat - the borderlines between friendship, lust and love, dedication to art and experience versus practical concerns, jealousy, rivalry, cowardice and egotism versus heroism and self-sacrifice and more.  	1

Let's start with all the problemsthe acting, especially from the lead professor, was very, very bad.    I think he's the most difficult of all of us, for he never really has to see what the problems are	0
The script is a big flawed mess.   The entire scene is a bit over the top with only the first few lines really really being true. The only thing that sticks out is the line "you're all good for me, I know that	0

To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.   I think it's a great film, and if you're a fan of horror it is possible to	0
