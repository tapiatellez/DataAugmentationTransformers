It Was So Cool.  	1
Plus, it was well-paced and suited its relatively short run time.  	1
I gave it a 10  	1
It's also great to see that renowned silent screenwriter Frances Marion hasn't missed a step going from silent to sound.  	1
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
It even has its sweet moments.  	1
I must say I have taped most of the episodes and i find myself watching them over and over again.  	1
I don't know exactly what it is about this movie, but we latched on to this endearing movie and it has become a special part of our family's memories.  	1
I totally and absolutely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good wholesome family movies because that is exactly what this is.  	1
This was such an awesome movie that i bought it off of Ebay.  	1
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  	1
For people who are first timers in film making, I think they did an excellent job!!  	1

Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
The camera really likes her in this movie.  	1

I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1

Overall I rate this movie a 10 out of a 1-10 scale.  	1
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1
the cast was great.  	1
The original Body and Soul (1947) is a masterpiece.  	1
The characters were all funny and had the peculiarity of not having a true lead character.  	1
Perabo has a nice energy level and is obviously very comfortable in front of a camera.  	1
Go watch it!  	1
VERY funny!  	1
The characters are interesting and you really care for them.  	1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
His acting alongside Olivia De Havilland was brilliant and the ending was fantastic!  	1
I have to say that this film was excellently produced and tops the ratings as a typical sci fi film!  	1
Excellent performance.  	1
If you love death and decay, and Shakespears lyrics... this is the one.  	1
Raw and sublimely moving.  	1
All of the main players are mesmerising.  	1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
This is just a great movie.  	1
Stanwyck and Morgan are perfectly cast in what is, in many ways, a modern equivalent of Dickens' Christmas Carol in its sensibility.  	1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
Very nice and relaxing late night viewing.  	1
The movie is full of wonderful dancing (hence the title!  	1
) a happy, wonderful, feel good ending!  	1
It's one of the movies I need to see whenever it comes on TV...never mind the fact that I already have it memorized!  	1
A very charming film with wonderful sentiment and heart.  	1
Technically, the film is well made with impressive camera-work, solid acting and effective music from Riz Ortolani Â– particularly good is a recurring unaccompanied female vocal that sounds like it's coming from a distant hill.  	1
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
10/10  	1
This film highlights the fundamental flaws of the legal process, that it's not about discovering guilt or innocence, but rather, is about who presents better in court.  	1
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
This film offers many delights and surprises.  	1
The story unfolds in 18th century Jutland and the use of period music played on period instruments is just one more fine touch.  	1
But this understated film leaves a lasting impression.  	1
You will leave the theater wanting to go out and dance under the stars.  	1
Very little music or anything to speak of.  	0
There was NOTHING believable about it at all.  	0
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0
My only problem is I thought the actor playing the villain was a low rent Michael Ironside.  	0
However, this didn't make up for the fact that overall, this was a tremendously boring movie.  	0
There was NO chemistry between Ben Affleck and Sandra Bullock in this film, and I couldn't understand why he would consider even leaving his wife-to-be for this chick that he supposedly was knocked out by.  	0
I saw "Mirrormask" last night and it was an unsatisfactory experience.  	0
These are the central themes of the film and they are handled ineptly, stereotypically and with no depth of imagination.  	0
A truly, truly bad film.  	0
Yeah, the movie pretty much sucked.  	0
Nothing at all to recommend.  	0
There were too many close ups.  	0
To those who find this movie intelligent or even masterful, I can only say - it's your intelligence and your imagination you obviously used to try and make some sense of this pitiful attempt (it's in our human nature to try and make sense of things) .  	0
 I love it.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
This movie is terrible.  	0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
The kids are very cool too.  	1
 But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  	0
The new characters weren't all that memorable, and I found myself forgetting who was who.  	0
I hate writing bad reviews about films - especially those in which I really like the star - but this film is so bad I don't believe for one second that anyone could have been proud of it.  	0
The plot doesn't hang together at all, and the acting is absolutely appalling.  	0
I know he was a contract player with little control over his scripts, but the acting was as bad as the script.  	0
At no point in the proceedings does it look remotely like America.  	0
About 30 minutes of footage is wasted to show mediocre elderly actors awkwardly babbling overwrought pseudo-Satanic gibberish corny enough to make a teen Goth blush, almost always in Olde English, and sometimes in Latin that may or may not be made up words.  	0
Hackneyed writing, certainly, but made even worse by the bad directing.  	0
20th Century Fox's ROAD HOUSE 1948) is not only quite a silly noir but is an implausible unmitigated bore of a movie.  	0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0
This may be the only bad film he ever made.  	0
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very, very bad idea all the way.  	0
I thought it was bad.  	0
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
To sum the film up, "Breeders" is a terrible, cheaply made horror movie that should be avoided like the Ebola virus.  	0
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0
With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent, this remake had little else to offer.  	0
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the original.  	0
Not recommended.  	0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	0
Omit watching this.  	0
The least said about the acting the better.  	0
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
It's so bad it's actually worth seeing just for that reason.  	0
) very bad performance plays Angela Bennett, a computer expert who is at home all the time.  	0
How awful she is!  	0
Im big fan of RPG games too, but this movie, its a disgrace to any self-respecting RPGer there is.  	0
Top line: Don't waste your time and money on this one, its as bad as it comes.  	0
It's an empty, hollow shell of a movie.  	0
It will drive you barking mad!  	0
Nothing new there.  	0
