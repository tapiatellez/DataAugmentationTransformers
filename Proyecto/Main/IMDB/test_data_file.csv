Give this one a look.  	1
The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going.  	1
The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip.  	1
The only thing really worth watching was the scenery and the house, because it is beautiful.  	1
But in terms of the writing it's very fresh and bold.  	1
I'd advise anyone to go and see it.  	1
This is definitely a cult classic well worth viewing and sharing with others.  	1
Highly entertaining at all angles.  	1
It features an outlandish array of memorable, psychotic but lovable nuts.  	1
I think the most wonderful parts (literally, full of "wonder") are the excerpts from his works.  	1
Here, in The Wind and the Lion, we see a wonderful rendering of America's own Imperial age.  	1
This is high adventure at its best.  	1
I think it was Robert Ryans best film, because he portrayed someone like my father, and he was a schizophrenic in real life,(my father) although he never murdered anyone but was affected more so during the second world war which made him worse.  	1
I liked it.  	1
Vivian Schilling did an excellent job with the script.  	1
This movie is excellent!Angel is beautiful and Scamp is adorable!His little yelps when hes scared,and the funniest parts are when:Scamp is caught under the curtain and when Angel and Scamp are singing 'Ive Never Had This Feeling Before'.I totally recommend this movie,its coming out on special edition on June 20.The cover has scamp on a garbage can and Angel underneath the lid.  	1
Still, it was the SETS that got a big "10" on my "oy-vey" scale.  	1
I like Armand Assante & my cable company's summary sounded interesting, so I watched it, twice already, and probably will again.  	1
I have seen many movies starring Jaclyn Smith, but my god this was one of her best, though it came out 12 years ago.  	1
Lifetime does not air it enough, so if anyone knows what store sells it let me know because this is a must-have.  	1
I found this move beautiful, enjoyable, and uplifting.  	1
Initially the local sites in the film, which was filmed here in Buffalo, intrigued me.  	1
Later I found myself lost in the power of the film.  	1
I left the theater with a lilt in my step, joy in my heart and hope for the human race.  	1
The rest of the cast also play well.  	1
For that, it's worth checking out.  	1
A mature, subtle script that suggests and occasionally brings into dramatic focus the underlying tensions is well served by perfect performances (apart from the odd inappropriate smiling that Keira Knightley is prone to, though perhaps under direction this time as the other characters themselves often mention it).  	1
It's as continuously beautiful to look at as a Bertolucci, but the relationships here are more convincing and the narrative more engaging than some of that master's work.  	1
I saw this film over Christmas, and what a great film it was!  	1
Lovely little thriller from Hitchcock, with lots of nice shenanigans surrounding a murdered spy, a kidnapped child, a nasty church, a foreign plot and some random taxidermists.  	1
Nevertheless yet another wonderful film from the great master's stable.  	1
Overall, a delight!  	1
Don't be afraid of subtitles........ its worth a little aversion therapy 10/10  	1
There still are good actors around!  	1
The aerial scenes were well-done.  	1
A good film by a great director!  	1
This is definitely one of the better documentaries I have seen looking at family relationships and marriage.  	1
You wont regret it!  	1
The success of the film depends on the casting of Sydney Greenstreet as the Alexander Yardley character.  	1
The attractive set used throughout most of the film is an eye-pleasing gem.  	1
) some great music, and terrific scenery.  	1
Emily Watson's character is very strong, and she has only to give a quick glance and you understand everything.  	1
It is rare when a film-maker takes the time to tell a worthy moral tale with care and love that doesn't fall into the trap of being overly syrupy or over indulgent.  	1
It's still wild stuff though and is highly recommended to fans of giallo cinema.  	1
The movie was very interesting from beginning to the end.  	1
PS the only scene in the movie that was cool is when the central character finds her room blown up.  	1
It's a fresh, subtle, and rather sublime effect.  	1
All the actors give a wonderful performance, especially Jennifer Rubin as Jamie Harris, who changes from the nervous starlet in the beginning through the strange events she is part of to the cool star.  	1
The movie in movie situations in the beginning and through the game that is played with her by the "acting coach" are fascinating.  	1
Predictable, but not a bad watch.  	1
It was clear that she had the range and ability to pull off this part.  	1
Constantine gives everything the right intensity and seems to have a good understanding of the underlying psychological motivations.  	1
When a song could explain the emotions of the subjects better, such as when Jay Adams' unfortunate life was a subject of talk, the song Old Man by Neil Young was played, which evokes many emotions.  	1
You share General Loewenhielm's exquisite joy in his partaking of the Cailles en Sarcophage even though you are just watching a movie - but you do wish for just a small sample to savor.  	1
It was horrendous.  	0
An hour and a half I wish I could bring back.  	0
The directing and the cinematography aren't quite as good.  	0
I could not stand to even watch it for very long for fear of losing I.Q.  	0
The only possible way this movie could be redeemed would be as MST3K fodder.  	0
It was so BORING!  	0
Worst hour and a half of my life!Oh my gosh!  	0
I mean this in a terrible way.  	0
 I love it.  	1
The ending is so, SO perfect... you'll shed a tear.  	1
I am so thrilled after seeing a movie like this.  	1
I will never forget it now.  	1
It is not just a cult... it is a cult CLASSIC.  	1
Which has more depth and character than the man underneath it.  	0
The Malta settings are as dry and as barren as the dialogue.  	0
This movie is terrible.  	0
The hockey scenes are terrible, defensemen playing like they're 5 years old, goalies diving at shots that are 10 feet wide of the net, etc.  	0
For those that haven't seen it, don't waste your time!  	0
To call this movie a drama is ridiculous!  	0
Started watching this but didn't believe in any of the characters.  	0
In particular the relationship between the bakery assistant and the waitress just didn't work for me at all.  	0
It was a very superficial movie and it gave me the feeling that I was watching play rather than a film.  	0
The characters were very 'stagey' and the storyline was a lot like a stage farce.  	0
By the time the pyromaniac waylaid the assistant I was bored and didn't care what happened next and so I switched off.  	0
Glad I didn't pay to see it.  	0
Didn't laugh or even smile once.  	0
But it wasn't anything at all just one big yawn...  	0
It is a really good show to watch.  	1
It is very educational for children 1 to 8 years old.  	1
Barney is definitely super DE duper.  	1
is pretty funny.  	1
Babie Bop is very cute.  	1
The kids are very cool too.  	1
 But "Storm Trooper" is not even bad enough to make it to the list of wonderfully terrible movies.  	0
Even if you love bad movies, do not watch this movie.  	0
I couldn't take them seriously.  	0
& That movie was bad.  	0
Now we were chosen to be tortured with this disgusting piece of blatant American propaganda.  	0
Almost everyone involved must be return to school, acting is utterly predictable and bad, script is pile of garbage all round.  	0
1/10 - and only because there is no setting for 0/10.  	0
Yes, I am simplifying things here for the sake of brevity, for this really is at the core of the problems with this film - it has too much going on without any real, fulfilling explanation.  	0
But the convoluted plot just didn't convince me, and much of the film was watched with a weird, questioning glance.  	0
Wow, what a bad film.  	0
Not even good for camp value!  	0
You'd have to have the IQ of particularly stupid mollusk not to see that one coming.  	0
The death row scenes were entirely unmoving.  	0
The acting by the whole cast could be put on a scale and balanced perfectly between overacting and underacting.  	0
It is just the sort of pap that is screened in the afternoon to punish the unemployed for not having jobs.  	0
By the time the film ended, I not only disliked it, I despised it.  	0
It is indescribably the most annoying and idiotic show I have ever seen.  	0
It is zillion times away from reality.  	0
Full of unconvincing cardboard characters it is blandly written by Edward Chodorov, who also produced, and is surprisingly directed by Jean Negulesco from whom one would expect a great deal more.  	0
From here on the Widmark character turns unintentionally comical!  	0
there are so many problems i dont know where to start.  	0
first of all, there are enough racial stereotypes and racial jokes to offend everyone.  	0
So bad...well...it's just bad.  	0
I thought it was bad.  	0
The movie is terribly boring in places.  	0
The film looks cheap and bland.  	0
I understand that it's supposed to be a cheap popcorn comedy, but that doesn't mean that it has to completely insult our intelligence, and have writing so incredibly hackneyed that it borders on offensive.  	0
The budget was evidently very limited.  	0
Not recommended.  	0
Every element of this story was so over the top, excessively phony and contrived that it was painful to sit through.  	0
There is simply no excuse for something this poorly done.  	0
In conclusion, I will not bother with this movie because a volcano in Los Angeles is nothing but nonsense.  	0
There's also enough hypocrisy in this film to make me vomit.  	0
Omit watching this.  	0
I can't see how this movie can be an inspiration to anyone to come out or overcome fear and rejection.  	0
The results, well, are a shame.  	0
That's how I'd describe this painfully dreary time-waster of a film.  	0
It isn't even an achievement as a "so-bad-it's-good" or "so-bad-it's-memorable" movie.  	0
